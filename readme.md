- Django 5.1.2
- PostgreSQL 
- PostGIS
- Any other key dependencies (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis)

I tried installing pygdal systemwide but got an error for version mismatch. I belive I have GDAL 3.9.3 installed now, and pygdal needs it to be 3.7.2. I'll see if everything works without pygdal, if not I'll probably have to uninstall gdal and use 3.7.2 (I think)
